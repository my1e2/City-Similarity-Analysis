# City Analysis

Write a Medium post describing use of similarity assessment for a data-science problem.

Using methods from module 3, identify at least 3 "query" entities of interest in a dataset you determine, develop a ranking of the most similar elements to these queries, and list the top 10 most similar entities for each query.

You may use any distance/similarity metric that is most appropriate for your analysis.  

Your post should include the following:

Describe a question you think can be answered by measuring similarity between data points, what specific stakeholder is asking this question, and what decision(s) the answer to this question will inform.

Describe the data that could answer this question, what fields it contains, and why it is relevant to your question.

Explain how you collected some subset of this data (e.g., libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, tweepy, praw, etc. or from data archive).

Define how you are measuring similarity between data points; include what features you are using for measuring similarity, and which similarity metric you are using.

For each of your chosen query items, identify the top 10 most similar items in your dataset and list them.

Provide an answer to your question, explaining your analysis of the data you collected, and how it answers that question.

Include figures or tables summarizing your findings. 

Discuss the limitations of your analysis. Whatâ€™s missing? How might it be biased?

Include a link to one of your GitHub repositories that contains the code you have developed for this assignment.

When you have written your post, publish it via Medium, add your post it to the class publication via Medium, and submit the URL to it via Canvas.

Example studies for this assignment include:

Ranking movies by similarity. E.g., what movies are most similar to The Matrix, where features might be actors, ratings from different websites, genres, dialog, color palette, etc.

Ranking Twitter users by similarity. E.g., for a collection of Twitter users, which users are most similar to Barack Obama, where features might be friends/followers, used hashtags, domains shared, etc.

Ranking subreddits by similarity. E.g., which subreddit is most similar to /r/aww, where features might be users who have posted in the subreddits, links to domains, words in the submission titles, etc.

Ranking webpages in a graph by similarity. E.g., in the Wikipedia graph, which pages are most similar to the Philosophy page, where you might use Wikipedia articles as features and measure similarity between vectors of outgoing article links.
